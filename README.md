# Music Mania!
An application developed using C++ and the concepts of Doubly Linked List. This project gives a real time experience on how people hear music, search and add songs most likely like a playlist. The user can switch from one song to another and can stop songs as well. 
This project is under development and I am currently exploring ideas to include other features.
